### CV_face_detection.ipynb
This notebook covers several face detection techniques:
- Detecting faces using the Haarcascade method with OpenCV.
- Detecting faces using the Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG) method with dlib.
- Detecting faces using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
- Real-time face detection using a webcam.

### CV_face_recognition.ipynb
This notebook includes the following tasks:
- Utilizing the open-source Yale Face Database.
- Recognizing faces using the Local Binary Pattern Histogram (LBPH) algorithm.

### CV_transfer_learning_classification.ipynb
This notebook performs the following tasks:
- Utilizes the Bart and Homer character dataset for a classification task.
- Uses ResNet50 as the base model.
- Applies transfer learning for classification.
- Implements fine-tuning for improved classification results.
- Fine-tuning yields significantly better results than simple transfer learning.
