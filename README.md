### CV_face_detection.ipynb
This notebook covers several face detection techniques:
- Detecting faces using the Haarcascade method with OpenCV.
- Detecting faces using the Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG) method with dlib.
- Detecting faces using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
- Real-time face detection using a webcam.
